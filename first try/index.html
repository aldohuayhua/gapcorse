            Born June 5th 1993 in Lima Peru then
            emigrated
            to the United
            States at 10 years old.
            Hold a bachelors degree in Human Resource Management from the Rutgers School of
            Management
            and
            Labor
            Relations in New Brunswick NJ.
            Currenlty have 3 years of professional Human Resource experince, but am looking to
            make
            a
            career
            change.
            Ideally into a technical positions, currently enrolled in the Rugters University
            coding
            bootcamp.
            Residing in Metuchen NJ, ideally located in central jersey, can travel to many
            different
            locations as
            required.
            Can be in NYC within 40mins or philadelphia within 1 hour, commute will not be a
            challenge
            when
            it comes to
            my next professional role.
            All I look for is to be in a tehcnical posiions, would prefer one where Web/Software
            Development
            is the main
            purpose.
            I am a very analytical and detail oriented individual and can complete reports and
            analyze
            data
            very easily,
            Im very adept with excel and can use pivot tables, v lookups, functions and macros
            with
            ease.
        </p>
